Project-Euler
=============

My Project Euler solutions written in haskell

Please first try to solve problems independently before seeking for help.

I write a module  "ProjectEuler.Everything" to keep some common functions,
you can include `${PROJECT_DIR}/lib/` in your ghc's search path.

for example:

`runghc -i/home/foo/bar/lib/ somecode.hs`
