# Javran's ProjectEuler Workspace

This directory is supposed to be the new project home for the migration.

## Directories

- `src/ProjectEuler` is the place for both solutions and stuff
  commonly shared. In particular, `ProblemX.hs` where `X` is a number,
  is the program for the corresponding problem.
